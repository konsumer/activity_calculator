# activity calculator

I thought the [Metabolic equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent) and [Compendium of Physical Activities](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2011/08000/2011_Compendium_of_Physical_Activities__A_Second.25.aspx) data was interesting, so made a little activity log using react.

See it in action [here](http://konsumer.js.org/activity_calculator/).
